# Songbook

There are twelve distinct notes on the piano, but most songs don't use them all. Just as each painting includes some colors and excludes others, each song has its own harmonic palette. My project makes use of relational databases to analyze songs which use a similar palette.

## Data Pipeline

There are a lot of webpages which list which chords appear in which songs, because people want to know how to play the songs at home. This project scrapes a guitar tablature website to get this information.
