# Songbook

There are twelve distinct notes on the piano, but most songs don't use them all. Just as each painting includes some colors and excludes others, each song has its own harmonic palette. My project makes use of relational databases to analyze songs by their harmonic palettes. 

In music theory, a __mode__ is a subset of the twelve available notes which is popular enough to receive its own name. (For example, the Mixolydian mode consists of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, b7}.)

## Data Pipeline

There are a lot of webpages which list which chords appear in which songs, because people want to know how to play the songs at home. This project scrapes a guitar tablature website to get this information.

## Use

If you want to insert your own modes, you can use `setup-schema.mode_input`. You can then search for songs which the database finds to be closest to that mode. One can find a number of examples on ![d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)#Other_types).
